    "\n",
    "* Introduce use of pandas with python\n",
    "* Get comfortable with Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "* Hands on workshop which does not require prior python training\n",

    "\n",
    "* Command line\n",
    "* Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - Spyder\n",
    "* Notebooks - Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab.  Use the one more comfortable to you:\n",
    "  * Jupyter Notebook has been around for some time and has one tab per notebook in your browser\n",
    "  * Jupyter Lab is an updated version and has one tab containing all notebooks and tabs within the browser tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientists primarily use notebooks because the code and its output are kept together.  This allows others to review your lab notebook and its output rather than having to re-run your code to see its output.  Because other people may not have the time or data to re-run, they can review the output alongside the code which generates it.  This pairing practices accelerates learning and code review.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab work?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start the Jupyter environment it can run muliple interactive python notebooks (.ipynb).  When each is started it will have its own python session running behind it.  You restart a notebook's python session by \"restarting the kernel\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notebooks are more like SQL Management Studio than other Development Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "With a notebook, the user should be aware of the order in which the cells (groups of commands) have been run:\n",
    "* Notebooks build up state (variables) as you run cells.\n",
    "* Notebooks have no direct sense of the order of cells.  The state (variables) depend on the order in which *you* run the cells in the notebook.\n",
    "* Jupyter Notebook lets you run cells in order.  That is up to you.  \n",
    "* If you do not run a cell, then the code has not executed yet!\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "* If you run cells out of order you might get different results\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are confused about python state as you work through a Notebook, you have a remedy:\n",
    "* Use the menu option *Kernel - Restart* to restart the entire python process, wiping out all variables, and giving you a fresh start.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple cell types, and you will edit code cells in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comments you encounter between code cells are *markdown* cells (see drop down top center for type).  Markdown cells can also be highlighted to \"run\".  When you run a markdown cell it interprets the markdown, replacing it with the resulting output.  You can double click on a markdown cell to edit it, and then hit the Run button to convert back to markdown output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise: Double click on this cell -- this text -- right now to see the markdown source and then click the \"Run\" button to put it back as markdown output. "
